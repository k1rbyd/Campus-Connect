# Campus Connect - Cisco Packet Tracer Project

## Description

Campus Connect is a network simulation project designed using Cisco Packet Tracer. It replicates a campus network setup, connecting multiple devices across different departments and areas of a college or university. The project demonstrates how to configure and manage routers, switches, access points, and end devices (such as computers and printers) in a campus network environment.

## Features
	•	LAN Configuration: Simulating Local Area Network (LAN) for various departments like Engineering, Library, Admin, etc.
	•	Routing Protocols: Configuring routing protocols such as OSPF, RIP, or EIGRP to connect different departments and ensure efficient routing.
	•	VLAN Setup: Implementation of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to segregate traffic between different departments.
	•	Wireless Network Setup: Configuration of wireless access points to enable Wi-Fi connectivity across the campus.
	•	Security: Setting up basic security features such as ACLs (Access Control Lists) to control traffic flow within the network.
	•	IP Addressing: Assigning IP addresses using static or dynamic methods (DHCP).
	•	Troubleshooting: Diagnosing and fixing common networking issues within the simulated environment.

## Technologies Used
	•	Cisco Packet Tracer: Used for network simulation and device configuration.
	•	Routing Protocols: OSPF, RIP, or EIGRP (depending on the project setup).
	•	VLAN: VLAN creation and configuration for different departments.
	•	Wireless Networking: Setting up and configuring wireless access points.

## Installation
	1.	Install Cisco Packet Tracer:
	•	Download and install the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer from Cisco Networking Academy.
	2.	Download the Project:
	•	Download the project file from the GitHub repository or from your local storage.
	3.	Open the Project:
	•	Launch Cisco Packet Tracer and open the .pkt file (Campus Connect).
	4.	Run and Test:
	•	Test connectivity by pinging devices across different VLANs and departments.
	•	Verify the routing configurations and ensure all devices are connected as per the design.

## Usage

Once the project is loaded in Cisco Packet Tracer, you can explore and test various features like:
	•	Pinging devices across the network.
	•	Simulating different traffic scenarios.
	•	Viewing the network topology and ensuring all devices are connected correctly.
	•	Accessing and managing routers and switches via the CLI.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute improvements or additional configurations to the project. You can:
	•	Fork the repository.
	•	Make your changes (e.g., add more devices, improve the design).
	•	Submit a pull request with your updates.
